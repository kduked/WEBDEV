		   <figcaption>Going to the gym has become more of a habit for me than a hobby i feel weird when I dont get go.  I started going in the fall of 2023 and have not gone a week without going since.  I try to go 5-6 days a week on a push pull legs split.  I have been trying to balance going to the gym with rock climbing.</figcaption>
